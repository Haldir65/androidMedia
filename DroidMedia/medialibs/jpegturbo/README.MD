libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, Arm, PowerPC, and MIPS systems, as well as progressive JPEG compression on x86, x86-64, and Arm systems.
On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal.
